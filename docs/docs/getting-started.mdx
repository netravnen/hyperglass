## Automatic installation

If your system runs on:

- Ubuntu Linux
- ~~CentOS/Red Had Linux~~
- macOS (requires [homebrew](https://brew.sh))

You should be able to proceed with the automatic installation:

```shell-session
$ curl https://install.hyperglass.dev | sudo bash
```

:::caution Piping to bash
You should be <i>very</i> worried when someone asks you to do what I just did. Downloading a bash script from the internet and piping it to `bash` with root privileges is a terrible idea, unless you fully trust the source. Please don't trust me - go [look at the code](https://github.com/thatmattlove/hyperglass/blob/v1.0.0/install.sh) and determine for your self if it's safe to execute. If you feel it's not, please proceed with the manual installation (and [tell me why](https://github.com/thatmattlove/hyperglass/issues), so I can fix it).

## Manual Installation

### System Dependencies

#### Python

hyperglass is written in Python 3 and requires Python version 3.6 as a minimum dependency. Note for Ubuntu >= 22.04 LTS as of 2022-11 is Python cannot be higher than 3.8. Due to uvloop being unable to compile for Python >=3.9. Ubuntu 22.04 defaults to Python 3.10.

If you're confident upgrading your system's version of Python won't break your system (many Linux operating systems rely heavily on Python for package management and other system functions), you can install Python 3.6:

  defaultValue="debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' },
    { label: 'RHEL/CentOS', value: 'rhel' },
    { label: 'Ubuntu Virtuel Environment', value: 'ubuntu-venv' }]}>

<TabItem value="debian">

```shell-session
$ sudo apt install -y python3-dev python3-pip
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rhel">

Documentation for CentOS is still in-progress. However, it's been determined that these dependencies _may_ also be required, depending on the version of CentOS:

```shell-session
$ sudo yum install libtiff-devel libjpeg-devel openjpeg2-devel zlib-devel \
    freetype-devel lcms2-devel libwebp-devel tcl-devel tk-devel \
    harfbuzz-devel fribidi-devel libraqm-devel libimagequant-devel \
    libxcb-devel ncurses-devel
```

Until further testing with CentOS can be done, you should install the above dependencies _before_ installing Python 3. You may have to uninstall and re-install Python 3 if these dependencies weren't already installed.

You can install python from the CentOS 7 repository:

```shell-session
$ sudo yum install python3-devel python3-pip
```

But you can also use the [SCL repository](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-python36/)

```shell-session
$ sudo yum install centos-release-scl
$ sudo yum install rh-python36
```

On Ubuntu 22.04. Python3.8 is not available with all the required packages. Add 3rd party repo from launchpad to be able to install the required packages for a python virtual environment.

```shell-session
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3.8 python3.8-dev python3.8-minimal python3.8-venv
```

Create the folder `/{etc,opt}/hyperglass`. Add dedicated user `hyperglass` and group. Including a persistent log file `/var/log/hyperglass.log`.

```shell-session
$ sudo touch /var/log/hyperglass.log
$ sudo ln -s /tmp/hyperglass.log /var/log/hyperglass.log
$ sudo mkdir /{etc,opt}/hyperglass
$ sudo groupadd --system hyperglass
$ sudo adduser --system --home /opt/hyperglass --group hyperglass
$ sudo chown --recursive hyperglass:hyperglass /{etc,opt}/hyperglass
$ sudo chown hyperglass:hyperglass /var/log/hyperglass.log
```

Run the below commands as user `hyperglass`. Install the Python3.8 virtual environment to a new folder `/opt/hyperglass/venv`. We install an older asyncssh release, otherwise ssh to remote devices will fail due to breaking changes that make the newest releases incompatible with hyperglass 1.0.4.

```shell-session
$ python3.8 -m venv /opt/hyperglass/venv
$ . /opt/hyperglass/venv/bin/activate
$ pip3.8 install --upgrade pip
$ pip3.8 install asyncssh==2.7.0
$ pip3.8 install hyperglass
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can then verify your Python 3 version:

```shell-session
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.9
```

#### Other Dependencies

The hyperglass UI is written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). As such, some Javascript dependencies are required. hyperglass also relies on [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching purposes.
